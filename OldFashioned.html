<h1>The Old Fashioned</h1>


<h2>The Recipe </h2>

<p>
Although its origins are unclear, most bartenders agree that the 
old fashion is one of the mostwell known classic cocktails that 
is served today. A couple fingers of Whiskey (Base Spirit) , 
a bit of Sugar (Sweet), Water - in the form of ice (Dilution),
and Bitters (The Seasoning), one sip that could almost bring one
right to the bar top prohibition era speak easy. While the recipe has 
shifted from time to time and still has regional variations, 
the most commonly used recipe is listed below:

<h2>Pick Your Poison (The Base Spirit) </h2> 

<p>
The old fashioned is based on a cocktail that used gin or champagne at
its base. Although it is currently most common to order an old fashioned 
with bourbon as the base, the old fashioned can be ordered with any base 
spirit and sometimes has a split base of 2 or 3 spirits.

<h2>Accounting for Taste (Sweet & Seasoning)</h2> 

<p>

While Demerara Sugar Syrup and <a href= "https://angosturabitters.com/"> 
Angostura bitters</a> respesctively, are the go to for a house old fashioned 
these days.  A phrase echoed by many experienced bartenders, “There is no 
accounting for taste.” Rings clear in the old fashioned probably more than 
any other cocktail.Due to the simplicity of this cocktail, subtle changes 
stand out and make finetuning your preferred cocktail a fun endeavor rather 
than a tedious task. There is versatility in the sweet and seasoning
used for this cocktail that can change based on many things but 
typically changes based on the base spirit used.

<h2>Smooth & Cool (Dilution)</h2>

<p>Last but not least, Dilution. This is a crucial part of the
    Old Fashioned as it not only chills the drink, but it 
    also dilutes the alcohol level of the drink. This smooths out 
    "sharper" flavors and lets some of the more mellow flavors shine,
    such as woody barrel notes. The little bit of water that comes 
    from this as the ice melts help to further incorporate the liquids 
    as they are stirred.
